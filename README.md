> You need Replit to run it EVERYWHERE (dekstop/mobile)
> 1. Create replit account
> 2. Create repl, choose python, upload file "mentahan.tex", "dds2tex.py", "main.py", "requirements.txt"
> 3. They *must*  be on the same location
> 4. Run Repl, and then choose dds file, automatically downloaded.

WHAT DOES THE .PHP FILE HAVE TO DO WITH THEM??
==============================================
in case you want to use it without replit.

> this application can't run all the time, you have to turn the api key manually from replit itself (the project)
